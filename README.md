Google Guava
============

These slides use a modified [HTML5 slide template for Google I/O 2012](https://code.google.com/p/io-2012-slides).
Please refer the project site for details on how to edit these slides.


Hotkeys
-------

* Pressing 'h' highlights code snippets
* Pressing 'p' toggles speaker notes (if they're on the current slide)
* Pressing 'f' toggles fullscreen viewing
* Pressing 'w' toggles widescreen
* Pressing 'o' toggles overview mode
* Pressing 'ESC' toggles off these goodies


Presenter mode
--------------

The slides contain a presenter mode feature (beta) to view + control the slides from a popup window.

To enable presenter mode, add `presentme=true` to the URL: [http://localhost:8000/template.html?presentme=true](http://localhost:8000/template.html?presentme=true)

To disable presenter mode, hit [http://localhost:8000/template.html?presentme=false](http://localhost:8000/template.html?presentme=false)

Presenter mode is sticky, so refreshing the page will persist your settings.
